Introduction
============

Complex-valued convolutions could provide some interesting results in signal processing-based deep learning. A simple(-ish) idea is including explicit phase information of time series in neural networks. This code enables complex-valued convolution in convolutional neural networks in keras with the TensorFlow backend. This makes the network modular and interoperable with standard keras layers and operations.
